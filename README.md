# The crappy-crawler

The Crappy Crawler is a reconfigured $30 Maisto R/C car designed to become a self driving R/C car.

The Crappy Crawler is dubbed thee because of its terrible steering design, loppy/notchy suspension, and weak powertrain. When I say weak, I mean that once the battery voltage drops by 1V; itâ€™s basically dead. I would advise against this model for a project like this.
